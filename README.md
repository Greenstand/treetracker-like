# Project architecture
The TreeTracker Like System is Greenstand's new experiment using a monorepo structure. A monorepo is a single repository containing multiple distinct projects with well-defined relationships.

In the Like System, both the backend and frontend implementations are located in the `apps` folder. The backend is built on the NestJS framework. Shared resources for the backend and frontend are placed in the `libs` folder. Shared resources include objects, utilities, constants, etc.

# Database Design
The database design for the backend like project could be find [here](https://github.com/Greenstand/treetracker-like/blob/main/prisma/schema.prisma).

We are using Prisma to implement our database and the DBMS is Postgres.
